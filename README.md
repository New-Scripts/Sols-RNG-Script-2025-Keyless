# Roblox Sols RNG Script

Welcome to the official repository for the **Roblox Sols RNG Script**! This script is designed to bring powerful randomness generation functionality to your Roblox games, enhancing gameplay experiences with unique random number generation (RNG) mechanics. Whether you are developing a game that requires unpredictable outcomes or just need a robust RNG system, this script is perfect for your needs.

## Features

- **Randomized Gameplay**: Adds true randomness to various elements like loot drops, character stats, and game events.
- **Optimized for Roblox**: Specifically tailored to work seamlessly within Roblox Studio for game developers.
- **Customizable**: Easily modify the RNG values to suit your game's mechanics and style.
- **Open Source**: Fully open-source and free to use, modify, and distribute.
- **Lightweight & Efficient**: Designed with performance in mind to minimize any impact on your game's performance.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine or download the zip file:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Roblox-Sols-RNG-Script.git
    ```

2. **Add the script** to your Roblox game:
    - Open Roblox Studio.
    - In the Explorer window, right-click the game’s **ServerScriptService** or **StarterPlayerScripts** folder.
    - Select **Insert Object** and choose **Script**.
    - Copy the contents of the `SolsRNGScript.lua` file from this repository into your script.

3. **Customize the RNG settings** according to your game’s needs.

## How It Works

The Roblox Sols RNG Script uses advanced mathematical models to generate truly random values within your Roblox games. It can be applied to random loot tables, enemy spawn rates, skill chances, or any other mechanic where randomness is essential.

### Example Usage:
```lua
local rng = require(game.ServerScriptService.SolsRNGScript)

-- Example for random loot drop
local loot = rng:GenerateLoot()
print("Loot Drop: " .. loot)
```

### Customizing RNG:
You can adjust the randomness scale or seed to ensure fairness and balance within your game:
```lua
rng:SetSeed(12345) -- Custom seed value for repeatable results
rng:SetRange(1, 100) -- Range for random number generation
```
